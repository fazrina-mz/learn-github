Sure! Here's an example of how you can use Markdown to display your name in HTML:

```markdown
## Displaying Your Name using HTML

You can use HTML within Markdown to display your name:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Name</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <span style="color: blue;">Your Name</span>!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the HTML code creates a simple webpage that displays your name in blue color using a `span` element.

Remember, Markdown is primarily for formatting and displaying text, and it supports HTML code within its documents for enhanced formatting and embedding content.
```
When rendered, the Markdown document will display the HTML code along with an explanation of how it works. To see the actual result, you would need to open the HTML code in a web browser or an HTML editor.
```


## Example: Using an if-else Statement in Python

In Python, you can use the `if-else` statement to control the flow of your program based on conditions.

Here's a simple example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
